-- Whether the craft is armed, and whether that question can be answered at all.
--
-- One definition for the tool's own screens. The header's Reload refuses on isArmed(), its Save
-- refuses on isArmed() and asks on isUncertain(), and the menu registry locks an entry while the
-- first one holds -- but both predicates were file-locals in ui/home.lua, so a page that draws a
-- write button of its own had nothing to ask, and every page that grew one would have grown a
-- second, weaker test with it.
--
-- Not the only definition in the repository, and deliberately so. tasks/msp/runtime.lua reads the
-- radio's own ARM source to decide whether to carry configuration traffic at all, which is a
-- question about the link rather than about a screen; and widgets/dashboard/inflight/fcsetup.lua
-- answers with a NAMED refusal ("no_sensors", no link, armed) because it has to tell the pilot
-- which of the three it is. Neither is replaced here.
--
-- isArmed() answers the question the screen needs -- "paint the warning?" -- and answers false
-- for three different reasons: not armed, no sensor, no link. That is the right default for a
-- warning, which must not stand permanently on a radio that cannot know. It is the wrong
-- default in front of a WRITE, where "cannot tell" is not "safe to proceed".
--
-- isUncertain() is that remaining case, and it is deliberately narrow. A missing sensor module
-- is a broken tool and not this question; a link that is down cannot carry the write either, so
-- the write fails on its own terms. What is left is the case worth asking about: the link is up,
-- the module is there, and the flight controller does not report the arming flags -- no bridge,
-- or no slot for them among its forty telemetry sensors.

-- The tool asks isArmed() at the top of every pass (ui/home.lua, isModelArmed), but it wakes a
-- page only while the craft is NOT armed. So work a page runs across passes -- the ELRS link
-- sync's parameter walk and its paced writes -- never runs during an armed period, and on the
-- first pass after the disarm the craft reads as disarmed again: from inside that work, nothing
-- happened. The count is the witness that something did. Work that must not outlive an arming
-- notes the count when the pilot says yes and stops when it has moved; both edges count, so a
-- yes given while armed is spent by the disarm.
